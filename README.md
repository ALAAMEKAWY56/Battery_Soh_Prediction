# 🔋 Battery SOH Prediction using XGBoost and Stacking

This project focuses on predicting the **State of Health (SOH)** of lithium-ion batteries using machine learning techniques. By leveraging **XGBoost** and **stacking ensemble methods**, this model aims to provide accurate and robust SOH estimates for battery management applications.

## 📘 Notebook Overview

The main Jupyter notebook `xgboost-stacking_.ipynb` includes:

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Feature engineering for SOH prediction
- Model training using XGBoost and other regressors
- Stacking ensemble implementation
- Model evaluation (RMSE, MAE, R²)
- Visualization of predictions vs actual SOH

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
